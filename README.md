- **State Management**: Provider pattern for reactive UI updates
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient caching for optimal performance

## Message Status Updates

The app now includes real-time message status updates that work correctly when both users are actively in the chat screen. The status updates include:

- **Sent**: Message has been sent to the server
- **Delivered**: Message has been delivered to the recipient's device
- **Read**: Message has been read by the recipient

### How it works:

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: The chat screen continuously monitors for new messages using a StreamSubscription
2. **Automatic Status Updates**: When a new message is received while the user is in the chat, it's automatically marked as delivered and then read
3. **Efficient Processing**: Messages are tracked to prevent duplicate status updates and infinite loops
4. **Periodic Checks**: A background timer ensures messages are marked as read even if the real-time listener misses some updates

### Key Features:

- ✅ Real-time status updates when both users are in chat
- ✅ Automatic delivered → read status progression
- ✅ Memory-efficient message tracking
- ✅ Error handling to prevent chat disruption
- ✅ Periodic status verification

### Files Modified:

- `lib/features/chat/screens/chat_screen.dart`: Added real-time message status monitoring
- `lib/core/services/chat_service.dart`: Enhanced status update methods with better error handling

## Lazy Loading

### Performance Optimization

The app implements efficient lazy loading for chat messages to ensure smooth performance even with large message histories:

- **Initial Load**: Only loads the most recent 20 messages initially
- **Scroll to Load**: Automatically loads more messages when scrolling to the top
- **Loading Indicator**: Shows a loading spinner while fetching older messages
- **Smart Caching**: Caches loaded messages to prevent unnecessary reloads
- **Memory Efficient**: Prevents loading all messages at once to avoid memory issues

### Features

- **Edit Mode Indicator**: Clear visual indication when editing a message
- **Text Selection**: Automatically selects all text when entering edit mode
- **Validation**: Prevents saving empty messages or unchanged text
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed operations
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Safe deletion with confirmation prompt
